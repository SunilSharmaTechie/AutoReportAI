## Problem Statement

Manual monthly reporting is often slow, repetitive, and error-prone for data analysts, operations teams, and business units. Teams spend hours collecting data from multiple sources, computing key performance indicators (KPIs), writing performance summaries, and formatting Excel or PDF reports for stakeholders.

This fragmented process lacks automation and consistency. It often involves:

- Extracting data from CSV files, SQL queries, or API responses
- Performing calculations like MoM growth, totals, or breakdowns
- Writing human-friendly insights manually
- Reformatting visual charts and tables every month
- Embedding screenshots or notes as part of the report

There is no modern, developer-centric tool that combines all these tasks with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating summaries, all in a secure, offline-compatible environment.

**AutoReportAI ** addresses this challenge by offering an integrated reporting engine that ingests data, computes KPIs, generates executive summaries using GPT or open-source LLMs, and outputs well-formatted Excel and PDF reports — complete with charts and optional visuals — all through a simple command-line workflow.

## Demo Output Preview

Below is a sample snapshot of what AutoReportAI  generates after processing a typical departmental dataset. This helps users visualize what to expect from the Excel, PDF, and Markdown output files.

### Sample Excel Report (`.xlsx`)
**Sheet Structure:**
- `Sheet 1: Raw Data` → Full tabular data with filters and formatting
- `Sheet 2: KPI Dashboard` → Summary metrics (totals, growth, breakdowns)
- `Sheet 3: Visual Charts` → Bar, line, and pie charts dynamically rendered
- `Sheet 4: Executive Summary` → LLM-generated summary in clear business language

**Example Snippet (Executive Summary):**
> _"In March 2025, the Marketing department saw a 14.8% MoM increase in user engagement and a 12% decrease in ad spend, resulting in a 21% boost in conversion efficiency. The campaign targeting product B outperformed expectations. It is recommended to scale similar content formats in Q2."_

**Chart Example:**
- Bar chart comparing MoM performance across departments
- Pie chart showing category contribution to total revenue
- Line graph of trend over time

### Sample PDF Report (`.pdf`)
- Contains same content as Excel but formatted for clean printing
- Page headers, footers, title, and company branding available

### Sample Markdown Output (`.md`)
```markdown
